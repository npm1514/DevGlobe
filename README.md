# DevGlobe
This project is a collaborative effort of four junior developers using the MEAN Stack. DevGlobe primarily uses D3.js to display past *[DevMountain](https://devmounta.in/)* students' "impact on the world" by mapping the locations of their jobs found after DevMountain on an interactive globe. In addition, DevGlobe compares the costs of a typical 4 year University and other bootcamps to show how much money DevMountain's courses can help students save.
